## Based on Trustpilot's Data Collection

This application is based on Trustpilot's official privacy policy and demonstrates the types of data they collect for fraud detection:

- **Device Information**: IP address, browser settings, location data
- **Usage Patterns**: How users interact with the platform
- **Verification Data**: Information used to verify user authenticity
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage**: All data is processed locally in your browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Information is not sent to any external servers (except for IP/location lookup)
- **Real-time Processing**: All analysis happens in real-time on your device
- **Educational Purpose**: This tool is for demonstration and educational purposes only

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The application automatically collects device, network, and behavioral data that fraud detection systems typically gather
2. **Real-time Analysis**: Behavioral patterns are analyzed as you interact with the page, including mouse movements, typing patterns, and click behaviors
3. **Risk Scoring**: Multiple algorithms evaluate potential fraud indicators including:
   - Typing speed and rhythm analysis for review authenticity
   - Mouse movement patterns for bot detection
   - Network analysis for VPN/proxy identification
   - Device fingerprinting for unique device identification
4. **Visual Feedback**: All collected data is displayed in real-time with detailed explanations of how each data point is used for fraud detection
5. **Interactive Demo**: Type in the review box to see live analysis of your writing patterns and behavior

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no external frameworks)
- **APIs Used**:
  - IPify.org API for IPv4/IPv6 address detection
  - FreeIPAPI.com for comprehensive IP geolocation and VPN detection
- **Fingerprinting Technologies**:
  - Canvas API for graphics rendering fingerprints
  - WebGL API for GPU hardware identification
  - Web Audio API for audio context fingerprinting
  - Navigator API for browser and device information
- **Real-time Analysis**: Event-driven behavior tracking and pattern recognition
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices
- **No External Dependencies**: Self-contained with minimal external API calls

## How to Use

Visit the **[live website](https://trustdetect.lucanl.dev/)** and:

1. **Allow location access** when prompted (optional) to see GPS vs IP location comparison
2. **Type in the review text area** to see live typing pattern analysis and fraud detection
3. **Interact naturally** - move your mouse, click, and scroll to trigger behavioral tracking
4. **Hover over "?" icons** for detailed explanations of each data point
5. **Click "Refresh Data"** to reset all counters and restart the analysis
